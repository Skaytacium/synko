## Syncplay on Kodi
### What?
[Syncplay](https://syncplay.pl/) on [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). Literally. I've implemented the [JSON over TCP/IP protocol](https://syncplay.pl/about/protocol/) that Syncplay uses in a Kodi service, so it's running a very minimal Syncplay client on Kodi.

### Why?
Wanted to watch movies on my TV with my friends. Got tired of waiting.

### And?
This is technically a personal project, but if there are any issues or interesting enhancements then I'll probably add them.  
This is only tested on Kodi v19.4 (Matrix)

### To-do?

- [ ] TLS support
	- Nah (unless someone opens a pull request)
- [x] Better error handling?
